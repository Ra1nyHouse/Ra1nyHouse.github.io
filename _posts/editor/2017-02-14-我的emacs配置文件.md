;; turn on highlight matching brackets when cursor is on one
(show-paren-mode 1)

(setq make-backup-files nil) ; stop creating backup~ files
;(setq auto-save-default nil) ; stop creating #autosave# files

;; backup in one place. flat, no tree structure
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("" . "~/.emacs.d/emacs-backup")))

 ;; enable line numbers globally
(global-linum-mode t)
(setq linum-format "|%d| ")

;; ------------------End---------------------------

;; ----------Emacs ELPA----------------------------
;; 要安装的包写在myPackages里面，会自动安装
(when (>= emacs-major-version 24)
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list
   'package-archives
   '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
   t)
  (package-initialize)
  (when (not package-archive-contents)
  (package-refresh-contents))

  (defvar myPackages
    '(monokai-theme
      helm
      elpy))

  (mapc #'(lambda (package)
    (unless (package-installed-p package)
      (package-install package)))
      myPackages)
  )

;; ------------------End---------------------------
